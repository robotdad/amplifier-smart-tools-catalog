  Anything to do with a video file the user has — .mp4, .mov, .mkv, .webm. Reach for it when the ask sounds like "cut this down to the bit where she explains pricing", "add captions to this", "make this shorter", "stick these three clips together", "speed up the boring middle", "put some music under it", "put the webcam in the corner and grow it to full screen", "where does he mention the deadline?", or "make this match our brand colours". Trims and cuts, joins clips with transitions, retimes and ramps speed, zooms, lays one clip over another as a picture-in-picture (shaped, keyed, animated), burns in captions, removes/replaces/mixes audio, grades colour or matches a reference image, vignettes, writes and speaks a narration fitted to the video's own timing, finds a moment by what was SAID or SHOWN, and verifies a finished render. Chain the verbs with pipes — the whole edit is one ffmpeg pass. Do NOT use for images, audio-only files, or downloading video.
use_cases:
  - Trim a video down to one section, or cut a section out of the middle
  - Join several clips together, with or without a transition between them
  - Speed a recording up, slow it down, or ramp the speed across a stretch
  - Burn captions into the picture from a subtitle file
  - Lay one clip over another as a webcam inset, a logo or a reaction shot
  - Grow an inset to full screen, cut it to a circle, or key out its background
  - Find the moment someone said something, or the moment something appeared on screen
  - Replace, remove or mix the audio, or lay a music bed under a demo
  - Match a video's colour to a reference image, or apply a named look
  - Write a narration from a prompt and speak it so it fits the video's own timing
  - Check that a finished render is actually what was asked for

requires:
  - name: ffmpeg
    purpose: >-
      Decodes, filters and encodes video. `render`, `verify`, `index` and `recolor` cannot
      work without it. `recolor` is the one exception among the plan-building verbs: it
      samples frames from the source video and a reference image to measure a palette
      while the plan is still being built, so it touches ffmpeg immediately rather than
      waiting for render. Everything else that only builds an edit plan -- trim, cut,
      retime, zoom, stitch, caption, plan, transitions -- runs fine without it, because a
      plan is JSON and nothing touches a frame until render. `vid check` reports which
      state you are in.

      ONE BUILD FEATURE MATTERS: `caption` burns subtitles in using ffmpeg's `subtitles`
      filter, which only exists when ffmpeg was compiled against libass. Some Homebrew
      taps and most minimal container images ship a build without it. Every other verb
      works on such a build; `caption` alone does not, and `vid check` says so.

      On macOS there is a second step behind the same verb: libass finds fonts through
      fontconfig, so a brew install that leaves its dependencies unconfigured can render
      captions with no text. `brew postinstall ca-certificates fontconfig gnutls glib
      openssl@3` is what fixed it on a real machine.

      OPTIONAL: TRUE, and the flag has to match the paragraphs above it. This
      said `false` while the same entry stated that trim, cut, retime, zoom,
      stitch, caption, plan and transitions all run WITHOUT ffmpeg -- so the
      manifest contradicted itself, and a caller trusting the flag would think a
      tool that works is broken. `false` means "nothing works without this",
      which is not true of vid: a plan is JSON and nothing touches a frame until
      render. What is genuinely unavailable without it is render, verify, index
      and recolor -- named above, and reported by `vid check`.
    optional: true
    install: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  - name: ffprobe
    purpose: >-
      Reads container metadata -- duration, resolution, stream presence. Declared
      SEPARATELY from ffmpeg because the code checks for it separately: `probe.have_ffprobe`
      is preflighted in its own right by `probe.duration`, `probe`'s stream reads,
      `lib.stitch`, `index` and `recolor`, each of which refuses by name when it is absent.
      A manifest that named only ffmpeg would leave a caller meeting a refusal for
      something the manifest never admitted existed.

      It ships WITH ffmpeg in every mainstream distribution and in the official builds, so
      installing ffmpeg almost always satisfies both and this is rarely a separate action.
      The exception is a minimal container image that installs an `ffmpeg` binary alone:
      there, every verb that only builds a plan still works, and everything that needs to
      know how long a clip is does not. `vid check` reports each one separately.

      OPTIONAL: TRUE, for the same reason as ffmpeg above and measured the same
      way: `probe.have_ffprobe` is preflighted by the operations that need
      duration data, NOT by the tool generally, so every verb that only builds a
      plan still runs without it.
    optional: true
    install: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
  - name: faster-whisper
    purpose: >-
      Transcribes speech locally so `index` can build timed passages and `find` can search
      them. Nothing is uploaded. Installed as an extra, not a separate step:
      uv tool install 'vid[speech] @ git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video'
    optional: true
    install: https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video#speech
  - name: piper-tts
    purpose: >-
      Speaks the narration `narrate` writes, locally. Nothing is uploaded, and the
      voice model is fetched once, anonymously. This is the DEFAULT of two
      ALTERNATIVE speech backends for `narrate` -- see openai-tts below for the
      other -- and nothing here ever falls back to the other automatically.
      Installed as an extra, not a separate step:
      uv tool install 'vid[voice] @ git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video'
    optional: true
    install: https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video#voice
  - name: openai-tts
    purpose: >-
      An ALTERNATIVE to piper-tts for `narrate`'s speech synthesis, reached only
      with `--voice openai:<voice>[@profile]`. Sends the narration TEXT (never
      audio, never a key) to OpenAI's TTS API instead of speaking locally --
      needs the `openai` package and an API key, named by `api_key_env` in
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vid/config.toml (or OPENAI_API_KEY with no config file
      at all). NEVER used unless a caller writes the `openai:` prefix; piper
      failing to load never falls back to it, because this one costs money.
      Installed as an extra, not a separate step:
      uv tool install 'vid[voice-openai] @ git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video'

      FORMAT LIMITATION: `requires[]` is a flat list with no vocabulary for
      "one of these two is enough" -- this entry and piper-tts are declared as
      two independent optional requirements, when `narrate` in fact needs
      exactly one of the two, not both. This is the most honest representation
      the current manifest schema allows; a real either/or relation between
      requirements is a gap in the Amplifier Smart Tool spec, not something
      this file works around.
    optional: true
    install: https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video#voice-openai

  - name: openai-api-key
    purpose: >-
      The CREDENTIAL the `openai-tts` extra needs, declared separately because
      installing the package and having an account are different prerequisites
      and fail at different moments. `narrate --voice openai:<voice>[@profile]`
      reads it from the environment variable named by `api_key_env` in
      $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vid/config.toml, defaulting to OPENAI_API_KEY when there
      is no config file at all. The key is never sent anywhere but OpenAI's TTS
      API, never written to a plan, and never logged.

      Declared because the code preflights it: `speech.interface` refuses
      before any synthesis when the named variable is unset, and the spec
      requires that refusal and this manifest to agree. Nothing else in the
      tool needs it -- every deterministic capability, and narration through
      the local piper backend, runs without any credential at all.
    optional: true
    install: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
  - name: gh
    purpose: >-
      Generates the token that signs in to GitHub Copilot. Without it, the model-backed
      capabilities cannot authenticate.
    optional: true
    install: https://cli.github.com/
  - name: github-copilot-subscription
    purpose: >-
      A Copilot subscription on the account signed in to gh powers the model-backed
      capabilities. Without it, only the deterministic capabilities run.
    optional: true

Edit and curate video: trim, retime, zoom, stitch, caption, and find moments by what was said or shown. Chainable — the plan-building verbs pass an edit plan, and one render compiles it to a single ffmpeg pass.

**The library is the tool.** `vid.lib` holds every capability. The CLI is a thin
wrapper over it, so anything you can do from the shell you can also do from Python.

## Read this first: chain the verbs, do not orchestrate them

**The plan-building verbs read an edit plan on stdin, append one operation, and
write the plan to stdout.** `render` compiles the whole plan into ONE ffmpeg pass.

Two exceptions, both stated because an agent that assumes otherwise gets them
wrong. `index`, `find`, `narrate`, `verify`, `check`, `manifest`, `transitions`
and `audio extract` report or read rather than appending to a plan. And
`recolor`, which does append an operation, still needs ffmpeg *while building*
-- it samples real frames to measure the palette. Every other plan-building
verb decodes nothing until `render`.

```bash
vid trim talk.mp4 --from 0:10 --to 2:30 \
  | vid retime --ramp "1x@0 0.25x@1:05 1x@1:12" \
  | vid zoom --to 1.4 --at 0:45 \
  | vid stitch - outro.mp4 --transition dissolve --duration 0.8 \
  | vid render out.mp4
```

That is five operations, **one decode and one encode**.

**Do not call these verbs one at a time, rendering between them.** It is the
obvious approach and it is the expensive one: five renders means five decodes and
five encodes, it takes several times longer, and the picture loses quality at
every generation. The pipe exists precisely so you never have to do that.

**You do not need a model in this loop.** Composing an edit is the shell's job,
not an agent's. Every verb in that chain is deterministic, instant, costs
**$0.00**, and needs neither ffmpeg nor any AI provider — a plan is JSON. Decide
the edit once, write the pipeline, run it.

Three rules that make chains predictable:

- **Start a chain by naming a file; continue one by piping.** `vid trim talk.mp4`
  begins. `vid zoom --to 1.4` continues whatever arrived on stdin. A verb given
  neither fails and says so.
- **`-` means "the plan on stdin"**, and it holds a position. `vid stitch intro.mp4
  - outro.mp4` puts the running edit in the middle.
- **Inspect before you commit.** `vid plan` prints the edit as JSON; `vid render
  out.mp4 --print-command` prints the exact ffmpeg and runs nothing. A plan can be
  saved, diffed, hand-edited and replayed, so an edit a model proposed is as
  reviewable as one a person typed.

## When to reach for it

- Edit and curate video: trim, retime, zoom, stitch, caption, and find moments by what was said or shown. Chainable — the plan-building verbs pass an edit plan, and one render compiles it to a single ffmpeg pass.

## When not to use vid

- **Images.** There is no video to build a plan against.
- **Audio-only files.** `vid audio extract` pulls audio OUT of a video; nothing here processes a standalone audio file as input.
- **Downloading video.** vid edits a file already on disk. It has no fetcher.

## Before writing code

Confirm every capability and argument against `vid <command> --help` before using it.
Do not fill gaps from memory. The library source beside this file, `lib.py`, carries the
signatures. The repository's `docs/01-library.md` and `docs/02-cli.md` carry the rest.

## Install

```bash
# as a CLI
uv tool install git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video

# as a library, from another project
uv add "vid @ git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video"

# once, without installing
uvx --from git+https://github.com/colombod/amplifier-smart-tools-video vid --help
```
Verify with `vid manifest`, which needs no credentials.

## Prerequisites

Verbs that only build or inspect a plan need `uv` alone. `render`, `verify`, `index`, and
`recolor` need ffmpeg on PATH -- they are the ones that touch a frame. `index`'s default
speech transcription also needs the `speech` extra (faster-whisper). Model-backed
capabilities run through GitHub Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user: `gh` must be
installed and `gh auth login` completed with an account that has a Copilot subscription.
Without that, a model-backed capability fails immediately and names what to configure; it
never falls back to a deterministic answer. Run `vid check` for exactly what this
installation can do.

Runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Straight and smart paths

Deterministic capabilities run with no provider configured. Model-backed capabilities go
through GitHub Copilot, signed in as the GitHub CLI's user, and say so in their help text.

## Output and failure contract

Results go to stdout, diagnostics to stderr. A failure prints a message naming what went
wrong and how to fix it, and exits non-zero: 1 for a failure the tool can name, 2 for a
bad invocation. Never treat an empty result as success.

## Choosing a surface

Import the library from Python. Shell out to the CLI from anything that cannot import
Python in-process: a shell script, a CI job, or an agent that can run commands but not
load a Python object. Both reach the same capabilities.
