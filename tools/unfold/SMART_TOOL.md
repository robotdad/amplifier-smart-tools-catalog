# Unfold

The Python library is the product. The CLI and optional loopback dashboard adapt
the same operations. Compositions are native 1920×1080 (default for new creations)
or 1280×720 at 30 fps, lasting one frame (1/30 second) through 60 seconds.
Set `Brief.output={"resolution":"1080p"}` or `{"resolution":"720p"}` in Python
or the same `output` object in CLI/MCP brief JSON. These are native authoring and
render dimensions, not an upscale. Settings are retained per brief and scene;
revisions, re-renders, overlays and delivery preserve them. Saved records without
the field remain 720p and are not migrated. Retrying an old acknowledged request
with its original omitted setting returns that request, not a new 1080p creation.
An explicit changed setting requires a new request ID. There is no resize-on-export
or automatic conversion of existing source; create new work for a different canvas.
The authoring profile supports text, cards, paths, polygons, circles, arcs, image
assets, stroke drawing, equal-point-count path morphing and camera motion. An embedded Amplifier Agent creates and
refines compositions; deterministic operations manage assets, packs and delivery.

For 3D video screens and video-textured nodes, include imported video assets in the
selected identity. Only asset names, roles and IDs go into the authoring asset list;
local paths and video bytes do not. Video is sampled at 15 fps and 512 px wide.
Each surface may require at most 60 source seconds after its media start, accounting
for playback rate; looping requires the full remaining clip. Frames must be at most
4096 px high at that sampling width. Atlas pages fit within 4096 × 4096 and the scene
may allocate at most 134217728 atlas pixels across all video surfaces, including
padding. Requests exceeding these bounds fail with `RESOURCE_LIMIT`, not silent
truncation, cropping or quality reduction. Short non-looped clips hold their last frame.

3D style controls are optional and independent. Node `entrance` is `"pop"` or
`"none"`; screen `entrance` is `"scale"` or `"none"`. None means hidden before
`appear_at` and full size at that time, including frame zero. Node `idle_motion`
is `"bob"` (legacy bob/tumble/ring motion) or `"none"`; explicit spin and
camera-facing media remain independent. Node `color:"#RRGGBB"` selects an sRGB
material tint independently of semantic role; lighting/material response still
affect its rendered colour, and video pixels are not tinted.
`floor_grid:false` removes the grid from an existing environment floor.
`post_overrides:{"bloom_weight":0,"glow_intensity":0}` disables both halo passes;
allowed ranges are 0–1 and 0–2 respectively. This does not remove material emission,
particles, label shadows or the preset's other post effects. Rings remain separately
selectable with `ring:false`. Omitted/null controls preserve legacy behavior.

`scene3d.background:"transparent"` makes only the 3D layer's backdrop transparent.
It preserves `Scene.background` and existing 2D properties, showing that CSS
background through the canvas while 3D objects remain beneath 2D graphics.
Environment lighting/reflections remain on objects; sky, stars and floor are
omitted (including a requested floor). Null/omitted or `"environment"` retains
the legacy backdrop, except that whole-scene `Scene.background:"transparent"`
still takes precedence. Effects and translucent materials can change pixels in
their coverage; this is not an unlit mode, a material/UV fix, or MP4 alpha delivery.
For this explicit transparent-layer setting, normal rendering acquires straight-alpha
RGBA from the generated 3D framebuffer using the pinned software browser and encodes
PNG frames in the library owner. The final stage uses ordinary images, not a visible
WebGL canvas, beneath the original 2D DOM and retains its existing capture policy.
Projected 3D labels are retained as bounded typed text/style/position/opacity records;
image and labels update together in an awaited seek. Failed decoding or label-layout
drift stops capture rather than accepting a stale frame. No prior-output cache is used.
Direct author-HTML previews still use WebGL and are not the final preservation surface.

Staging is limited to 512 mebipixels (frame count × native width × native height),
about 8.6 seconds at 1080p or 19.4 seconds at 720p/30fps; over-budget requests fail
`RESOURCE_LIMIT`, never silently trim or downscale. PNG files have a 2 GiB + 32 MiB
allowance and typed label metadata an 8 MiB allowance. Existing retained source assets
are additional; leave local disk headroom. Acquisition and final capture share the
render deadline, and owned temporary staging is cleaned up. The presenter decodes
sequentially; browser-internal caching and transient raw/encoded copies still use memory.

Unchanged source/layout and lossless uncovered-pixel checks establish different parts
of preservation. Adding content can change output pixels elsewhere through the normal
lossy JPEG-capture/H.264 pipeline; this is separate from exact decoded-frame repeatability
of the **same** revision on the **same** pinned runtime. Inspect actual delivered
appearance and legibility; do not infer cross-revision encoded equality from source
preservation, or excuse failed same-revision repeatability as ordinary encoding loss.

Compatibility: new schema normalization preserves legacy visual defaults, not old
3D runtime bytes. Existing 3D revisions must be rendered with their matching older
installed version; a new runtime can legitimately produce `SOURCE_CHANGED` during
the executable-source check. No automatic migration or bypass is provided. Keep
historical outputs/source and use an explicitly new revision for new controls.
2D-only compositions do not load this runtime and keep their existing behavior.

3D renders explicitly select HyperFrames' software GPU (SwiftShader) and screenshot
capture rather than auto-selecting host hardware. This code-owned policy applies
to ordinary 3D MP4 and alpha rendering. The explicit transparent-layer path instead
reads its software framebuffer directly, then presents images/labels with the original
2D capture policy as above. 2D-only capture selection is unchanged. Ambient renderer
overrides are not passed through. Software capture can be substantially slower
than hardware (about five times in one matched local capture test); allow for it
within existing operation budgets. Repeatability checks apply to the same pinned
renderer, browser and software-runtime environment, not arbitrary platforms,
CPUs, browser revisions or GPU drivers. Software and previous hardware outputs
can differ in pixels; unchanged source does not imply cross-backend equality.

Requested durations are rounded to the nearest whole 30-fps frame, with exact
half-frame ties rounded up, and stored as frame count / 30. A 2-second bumper is
60 frames; 2.5 seconds is 75; 2.52 seconds becomes 76 frames (2.533333… seconds).
Values below 1/30 second or above 60 seconds are rejected before rounding. The
general-purpose default remains 20 seconds. New briefs, scenes, review bounds,
video/overlay artifacts and handoffs share this canonical duration. Encoded
`frame_count` verifies that span; container duration displays can round to their
clock precision. Existing retained source keeps its authored timing on re-render.
Sampling chooses the frame containing each requested time; returned `time` is the
frame timestamp and `requested_time` preserves the request. Times must precede
the end; the final frame starts at duration minus 1/30 second.

Custom typography uses imported static TrueType (`.ttf`) and OpenType (`.otf`)
faces up to 32 MiB each. Family, numeric weight and style are read from the file.
Collections, web fonts, variable fonts and SVG fonts are rejected; supply a static
TTF/OTF face instead. Text/card elements select `font_asset_id`, optional
`font_weight` (1–1000), `font_style` (normal/italic/oblique), `letter_spacing`
(pixels, default 0) and `line_height` (multiplier, default 1.22). A selected file
must provide the exact weight/style and every non-whitespace character. No synthetic
bold/italic or silent font substitution is used. Omitting weight/style uses that
file's face; compositions without custom typography retain the system sans-serif.

Import each required face with `import-asset --role font`, then include its asset ID
in an identity's `asset_ids`. Assign roles inside pack guidance, for example
`{"typography":{"display":{"font_asset_id":"FONT_ASSET_ID"},"heading":{"font_asset_id":"BOLD_ITALIC_ASSET_ID","font_weight":700,"font_style":"italic"}}}`.
Roles guide the authoring agent; they are not automatic styles applied to every text
node. Font bytes stay local; the permitted agent receives metadata and sampled frames.
Rendered scenes retain and hash their used font dependencies and validate them with
the renderer's browser. Capture waits for font loading. Text stays editable and can
use the existing element animations. Retained scenes re-render without original
font paths; selected identity versions still require their pinned assets for new
model-backed work.

Identity ZIP imports remap role asset IDs to the new library. Identity exports and
delivery handoffs include only fonts declared redistributable and retain attribution;
unknown/restricted faces are listed as omissions. An identity with omitted faces has
unresolved prerequisites and cannot be used until repaired in a new version. Handoffs
contain rendered media and eligible font dependencies, not a full editable project.
Newly authored scenes retain the then-current rights declarations; handoffs also honor
any stricter current asset declaration. Declarations are supplied
by the caller, not a license verification service.

Studio review includes full-width Single, synchronized Compare, retained drafts,
bounded direct refinement, cancellation and observable outcomes. Identity ZIPs carry
guidance and eligible assets. Delivery supports silent transparent ProRes 4444 MOV
and H.264 MP4 with optional reference footage and imported audio.

Closed polygon paths can animate individual corner angles on a circular track,
with attached corner markers. This supports irregular shapes resolving into
regular polygons without corners leaving the track.

This is not the entire draft vision. Arbitrary HTML/CSS, external source-edit adoption,
editable project ZIP round trips, transcription, audio generation and renderer
migration are not supported. Custom typography requires supplied static font faces;
web/variable fonts and automatic font substitution are not supported. Reusable
motion/recipe files are stored as inert assets, never executed on import.

## Installation

Python 3.12+, Node.js and FFmpeg are prerequisites. From a checkout:

```sh
uv sync --extra smart
uv run unfold manifest
```

Install from Git:
`uv tool install "amplifier-smart-tool-unfold[smart] @ git+https://github.com/robotdad/amplifier-smart-tool-unfold"`.
The repository is private; the installing caller needs access. Without `[smart]`,
deterministic capabilities work but creative operations require installing the extra.

Install pinned renderer dependencies into a selected directory outside the Python
installation, once. For the default backend directory:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/unfold-backend
unfold backend-package > ~/.local/share/unfold-backend/package.json
npm install --prefix ~/.local/share/unfold-backend
unfold doctor
```

Only run that redirection for a new dedicated backend directory; it writes a package
manifest. HyperFrames may prepare its Chromium binary on the first render. Creative
calls do not run npm or initiate authentication. The smart extra installs Amplifier
Agent v0.20.0's public Python binding and its runtime dependencies. Unfold does not
independently pin or intercept provider modules.
Production guidance is packaged. No private skills directory is required.

### Linux renderer prerequisites

On Ubuntu 24.04, install the unzip utility and Chromium shared libraries before
rendering. Package names differ on other Linux distributions:

```sh
sudo apt-get install unzip libnss3 libnspr4 libatk1.0-0t64 libatk-bridge2.0-0t64 libcups2t64 libdrm2 libxkbcommon0 libatspi2.0-0t64 libxcomposite1 libxdamage1 libxfixes3 libxrandr2 libgbm1 libpango-1.0-0 libcairo2 libasound2t64
```

## Library and authority

```python
from unfold import Unfold, Brief, Grant

tool = Unfold(library="/chosen/library", backend="/chosen/backend")
grant = Grant(
    provider="gemini", model="gemini-3.7-flash", allow_context=True, allow_frames=True, vision=True
)
outcome = tool.create(
    Brief(
        title="A request through our system",
        intent="Show how the caller delegates to an agent and receives an artifact.",
        context="Actual component roles and relationships supplied by the caller.",
        identity="Navy, mint and gold; restrained movement.",
        duration=20,
    ),
    grant,
)
if outcome["status"] == "completed":
    artifact = tool.artifact(outcome["primary_artifact_id"])
```

`Brief.context` is actual supplied content, not a filename the agent should discover.
The caller explicitly permits disclosure of brief, context, identity, feedback,
composition data and sampled generated frames to the chosen model. No unrelated
filesystem material is available to the embedded agent. This profile requires a
vision-capable model; a false capability declaration will not make a text-only model
see images. `Grant` limits local tool actions, renders, sampled frames and wall time;
`unfold schemas` exposes bounds. Inference behavior is owned by Amplifier Agent,
not private Unfold provider controls. Models are chosen explicitly; no
model fallback or authentication is initiated. For Gemini, the first nonempty
`GEMINI_API_KEY`, then `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, wins. Doctor, provider configuration and
worker environments use that same precedence. OpenAI uses `OPENAI_API_KEY`;
Anthropic uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Only the selected provider's credential reaches
the worker. Aliases never change `Grant.provider` or `Grant.model`.
Doctor reports presence and the chosen variable name, never the value.
Credentials never enter scene data.

The embedded agent authors validated scene data. Code emits executable HyperFrames
source; arbitrary model JavaScript, remote assets and custom CSS are not accepted.
The agent can render, sample encoded frames, repair and submit within one shared
allowance. A model completion sentence alone is not a result. Sampled-frame model
review is labeled and is not continuous playback inspection or human approval.

State defaults to `~/.local/share/unfold`; select `library` explicitly to change it.
The backend defaults to `~/.local/share/unfold-backend`. Both paths belong to the
process running Unfold. Output references identify Unfold-managed bytes; export
creates a new caller-owned copy and refuses overwrite. Large input files are passed
by path to `import_asset`, not embedded in JSON. The default is a managed copy;
`mode="reference"` keeps an external dependency. Neither mode moves or deletes the
original. Use `remove` for managed deletion, never delete returned paths as an API.

## Capabilities

All results are JSON-compatible dictionaries/lists; validated creative inputs are
`Brief` and `Grant` objects or matching dictionaries. Errors use `UnfoldError` with
code, message and remedy. CLI stdout is JSON; diagnostics use stderr, and errors or
failed/cancelled/interrupted operations exit nonzero. Closed stdin never triggers a prompt.
Use library return values for chaining. `--help` prints this skill, `-h` prints a
synopsis. Every subcommand’s `--help` is a capability skill with arguments, examples,
results and recovery guidance; `-h` is its short flag reference.

Global CLI options `--library PATH` and `--backend PATH` precede the subcommand.

### Exact-file delivery

For blocking creation, add `export_to="/existing/exports/The convergence loop.mp4"`
to `tool.create(...)`, or `--export-to '/existing/exports/The convergence loop.mp4'`
to `unfold create`. The parent must exist. This is an exact file, never a directory:
matching extension is mandatory, spaces and valid Unicode are preserved, unsafe/device
names are rejected. Destinations are not sent to intelligence.

Completed operations retain `primary_artifact_id` and `outputs` (exact artifact and
revision, role, format, SHA-256, suggested filename), also available in `inspect`
and completed async `job.result`. Legacy missing/ambiguous initial outputs report
`output_error`; choose an explicit artifact rather than assuming first/latest.
Suggestions use NFKC, lowercase Unicode letters/numbers, hyphen separators and a
180-byte UTF-8 stem bound, with an artifact-ID fallback. They do not rename existing
download defaults and are not globally unique.

Generation `status` and the separate `export.status` are independent. Copy failure
preserves generation; CLI stdout includes the partial result and exits nonzero.
Keep the returned operation `id` and `export.receipt_id`; supply the operation ID as
`request_id` for exact retry. Without it another invocation is new work.
Same input/destination recovers the original receipt even if its caller copy was
subsequently deleted or changed: this is historical success, not current integrity.
Relative paths and parent symlinks are anchored once; a changed destination conflicts.
Omitting `export_to` on an export-bound retry retains the original delivery intent;
it does not cancel it. An old no-export request remains a no-export request.
A crash before copying can resume that deterministic step only. Uncertain copying
reports `MUTATION_INCOMPLETE`, never automatic replay. Inspect the receipt, then use:

```sh
unfold export-file PRIMARY_ARTIFACT_ID '/existing/other-disk/Result.mp4' \
  --request-id fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210
```

`export_file(artifact_id, destination, request_id=None)` needs no grant, credentials
or renderer. It verifies retained bytes and owned sibling staging, then publishes
atomically without replacement using POSIX descriptor-relative hard links. Existing
entries (including identical files/symlinks) conflict; there is no force/auto-numbering.
Windows exact-file export is explicitly unsupported; no weaker fallback is automatic.
Filesystem hard-link/fsync errors are reported. Normal failures remove only owned
staging; crash leftovers are named in the retained intent's `staging_path`. Inspect
before deliberate cleanup. This does not confine an unrestricted malicious same-user
process moving held directories. Cancellation cannot undo committed media or published
copies; interruptions report incomplete delivery. Legacy `export ARTIFACT DIRECTORY`
keeps its directory creation, download names and direct-copy interruption limitations.

Async `submit_creation` does not accept a destination or auto-export; queued/running
jobs promise no output readiness. MCP App downloads remain opaque bytes saved by the
host, not server-local `export_to` destinations.

### Interrupted direct creation and revision

Keep a `--request-id` before launching. If the calling process or connection is
lost, use the **same library** and operation ID:

```sh
unfold --library /chosen/library inspect OPERATION
unfold --library /chosen/library observe --after 0
unfold --library /chosen/library reconcile OPERATION
# Only if stopping is intended:
unfold --library /chosen/library cancel OPERATION
unfold --library /chosen/library reconcile OPERATION
```

`inspect` and `observe` are passive retained reads, not liveness checks.
`reconcile(operation_id)` is deterministic library behavior: it never launches
intelligence or retries an external call. A still-live launcher or bounded owned
worker remains active. A worker supervisor enforces the original deadline even
if the caller disappears. After exit, reconciliation validates an existing result
through the same commit checks as normal completion, or records `interrupted`
without discarding local evidence. Committed revisions and terminal failures are
not overwritten. Exact request retries return the retained operation, never a new
dispatch; changing input under that ID is a conflict.

`cancelling` means requested, not stopped. Reconciliation can stop birth-verified
owned workers and observed descendants; only successful cleanup reports
`cancelled`. Missing workers can yield `interrupted`, not a cleanup guarantee.
Uncertain external calls may already have completed. Review retained events and
results before explicitly authorizing a new operation and budget.

Supervisor exit alone is not cleanup: the launcher and reconciler separately
check the retained execution child's birth identity before terminalizing failure.
A cleanup denial remains `cancelling` with `cleanup_status: pending` and
`recovery: cleanup_incomplete`; retry **reconcile**, never generation.
If an execution root disappears, its descendants may have been reparented and
cannot be safely rediscovered from a PID or process-group guess. Cancellation
then reports `interrupted` with `cleanup_status: unverified`, even if the remaining
supervisor was stopped. `verified_observed` covers the birth-verified execution
root and descendants observed during shutdown, not arbitrary detached processes.
Unrecorded or already-detached descendants require independently established
ownership before any manual cleanup; Unfold does not certify their absence.

Legacy records with only a PID, inaccessible process identity, or another host's
identity cannot prove ownership: reconciliation returns `ownership_unknown`
without killing or pretending cleanup completed. A reused PID is never signalled.
No automatic paid replay or broad process cleanup is available. Review jobs use
`call cancel-job` and `call review-state`; their lost-launcher recovery delegates
to the same operation reconciliation.

The former `max_model_calls`, `max_text_bytes`, `max_image_bytes` and
`max_response_tokens` fields are unsupported. Remove them from old grant/configuration
files before starting new work; they now produce an actionable validation error,
not silently ignored limits. Retained scenes and outputs remain usable without
an agent. This migration does not promise an inference-cost or token ceiling.

Unfold uses Amplifier Agent's public sessions, scoped tools and typed image input.
After sampling, the agent must end its turn; verified JPEGs arrive in the next
user turn for review (including on Gemini, which does not support tool-result
images). Submission requires current rendered source and handed-off image evidence.
A validated submission is still only a candidate until the Agent turn succeeds.
Failed, rejected or cancelled turns never become success because a tool submitted.
`agent_terminal` events retain actual turn state, error code/category and reported
usage; absent usage means unavailable, not zero. Revision usage counts local tool
actions, renders and sampled frames, not provider requests or billed tokens.
`RESOURCE_LIMIT` identifies local limits or the operation deadline. Unfold does
not automatically replay a failed operation; provider-internal behavior is owned
by Agent. Retry the same request ID to retrieve its retained outcome.

Domain validation errors returned by Unfold tools are repairable within the remaining
local limits. Agent may terminate a turn for arguments that violate the tool's JSON
schema before invoking Unfold; that terminal failure is retained, not hidden. The first
three rejected author/patch payloads per operation are retained in local
`operations/OPERATION/rejected-CALL.json` diagnostics, each capped at 64 KiB, with
original byte count/hash and a truncation flag. Files are created with owner-only
permissions on POSIX; Windows uses the library directory's ACL. They may contain
supplied creative material. Public events contain a diagnostic reference and
field-level errors, not the rejected payload. Diagnostics are not exported or
sent back to providers automatically and remain until that operation's local
workspace is removed. Validation does not guarantee creative quality.

- `create(brief, grant, request_id=None)` / `create --brief brief.json --grant grant.json`:
  model-backed. Returns a retained operation; completion identifies the revision.
- `revise(revision_id, feedback, grant, request_id=None)` /
  `revise REVISION --feedback TEXT --grant grant.json`: model-backed. Requires the
  current intact base. Creates a new revision; preserves the earlier one.
- `projects()` / `projects`: list retained projects and revision IDs.
- `inspect(id)` / `inspect ID`: records, resolved artifacts, source integrity,
  feedback, grant and checks as applicable. Reading never starts model work.
- `artifact(id)`: resolve a saved output's current name, path, ownership and integrity.
- `observe(after=0)` / `observe --after CURSOR`: ordered durable changes with cursors.
- `rename(id, name)` / `rename ID NAME`: rename project, pack, asset or saved output without
  rerendering. Labels may repeat; IDs are unique. Downloads use the current name.
- `export(artifact_id, directory)` / `export ARTIFACT DIRECTORY`: verified media copy,
  no overwrite. Previously exported copies are not renamed or deleted.
- `render(revision_id)` / `render REVISION`: deterministic re-render of intact source;
  returns a new saved output without model initialization. No automatic repair.
- `feedback(revision_id, text)` / `feedback REVISION TEXT`: save a pending, targeted
  comment. This operation never launches work; `submit_refinement` is the separate
  authority-consuming operation.
- `address_feedback(feedback_id, revision_id)` / `address-feedback FEEDBACK REVISION`:
  link a submitted comment to the revision carrying its exact text and original base.
  Records the outcome without claiming human approval or triggering model work.
- `cancel(operation_id)` / `cancel OPERATION`: request cancellation; status remains
  `cancelling` until the active caller stops the worker and records the outcome.
- `doctor()` / `doctor`: report prerequisite versions and credential presence only.
- `dashboard(port=0)` / `dashboard [--port PORT]`: start a loopback, cookie-protected
  review service. Returned object has `url`, `close()` and context-manager support.
  CLI prints the private viewer URL, waits, and stops on Ctrl-C. No browser opens
  implicitly. Dashboard plays/scrubs, compares, retains drafts, applies authorized feedback,
  manages packs and exports. Composition source is never executed in the dashboard.
- `unfold.help.manifest()`, `schemas()`, `skill()`, `backend_package()` correspond
  to CLI `manifest`, `schemas`, `--help`, `backend-package` and need no provider.

Creative operations are synchronous but their operation record and ordered progress
are readable from another process. Supply a 32-character lowercase hexadecimal
`request_id` (CLI `--request-id`) for acknowledged retry protection: exact retries
return the prior state, including running/failed states, without spending again.
Different input with the same ID fails. After caller/process loss a record may remain
running; this means uncertain interruption, not permission to retry automatically.
Worker status checks do not send signals. Cleanup stops the owned worker tree;
recovery checks the exact worker command and request path before stopping it.
Direct synchronous calls need a live supervisor for cancellation. Dashboard jobs
reconcile completed or interrupted supervisors on `review_state`; they never restart
spending automatically. A new creative attempt requires a new request identity.

Retained source is native to this backend profile. Unexpected edits/missing files
are reported; they do not silently inherit checks. Do not treat SQLite tables or
directory naming as a supported caller protocol. Use public IDs and file references.
The full vision and contracts remain draft; packaging conformance is separate from
creative quality, motion correctness and review acceptance.

## Studio feedback

```python
tool.authorize_review(project_id, grant, refinements=2)  # 1–10 bounded operations
# These remain deterministic and never spend:
tool.save_draft(revision_id, "Move the callout; preserve pacing", at=3, end=5, sequence=1)
state = tool.review_state()
# Returns an acknowledged durable job; work survives closing the dashboard.
job = tool.submit_refinement(
    revision_id,
    "Move the callout; preserve pacing",
    request_id="0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",
    at=3,
    end=5,
)
tool.cancel_refinement(job["id"])
```

Draft sequence numbers are monotonically increasing per revision; older saves do
not overwrite newer ones. Apply consumes one allowance at acceptance, even if the
provider later fails. Exact retries return the same job without spending. Failed
or interrupted jobs require explicit new authorization when the allowance is used
up. Feedback on an old base is refused without moving or deleting the draft.
`review_state` exposes jobs, receipts, revisions, drafts, authority and events.
The dashboard cannot grant itself more authority. It inherits the launch process's
selected provider credential. Grant settings are snapshots, not secrets.

## Assets and packs

```python
logo = tool.import_asset("/chosen/logo.png", role="image", rights="redistributable")
pack = tool.save_pack(
    "Team",
    {"required": "Mint arrows; accurate labels", "adaptable": "Pacing follows the explanation"},
    asset_ids=[logo["id"]],
)
version = pack["current_version"]
# Pass identity_version=version in Brief, or deliberately adopt it:
# tool.adopt_identity(revision_id, version, grant, request_id=...)
exported = tool.export_pack(version, "/chosen/team.zip")
checked = tool.inspect_pack(exported["path"])
receipt = tool.import_pack(exported["path"], expected_sha256=checked["sha256"])
```

- `assets()`, `asset(asset_id)`, `packs()` and `inspect(version_id)` discover retained
  records, hashes, resolved paths and integrity. PNG/JPEG images from the selected
  identity can be used by the agent; renderer copies are decoded/re-encoded PNGs.
- `save_pack(name, guidance, asset_ids=[], pack_id=None, prerequisites=[])` creates
  a pack or a new immutable version. `guidance` is an object (up to 20 KB), typically
  `required`, `adaptable`, `examples`. Declared unresolved prerequisites block
  creative use; resolving them requires an explicit new version. Guidance is passed
  to the model; arbitrary prose requirements are not mechanically proven.
- `duplicate_pack(pack_id, name)` creates a local variation with origin observations.
  `adopt_identity(revision_id, version_id, grant, request_id=None)` creates a new
  model-backed revision, leaving the earlier revision pinned. Dashboard Adopt uses
  an existing review allowance through `submit_refinement(identity_version=...)`.
- `update_asset(asset_id, rights=None, attribution=None)` records declarations.
  Rights are `unknown` (default), `redistributable`, or `restricted`. ZIP export
  includes only explicitly redistributable assets; everything else is listed as
  an omission. Unfold does not verify legal permission. No account, sender or user
  profile is collected or automatically included.
- `dependencies(identity)` lists retained dependents. `remove(identity)` supports
  assets, packs and generated outputs, refuses retained asset/pack dependencies,
  preserves external originals and reports missing files. Removing an output leaves
  its composition source available. Names are labels; IDs, bytes and references
  survive renaming, including names that happen to be identical.
- ZIP inspection validates a mandatory manifest, supported format, hashes, declared
  contents and safe entries before exposing a contents view. Limits: 256 entries,
  256 MiB uncompressed, 1 MiB manifest, 257 MiB archive on disk. Individual asset
  intake is limited to 256 MiB. No extraction executes scripts or installs fonts.
- Import remaps to local identities and records origin identities. Repeated identical
  imports return the previous receipt; conflicting version claims fail.
  `import_pack(..., conflict="copy")` explicitly imports a separate variation.

### Caller direction and selected identity

`Brief.identity` is composition-specific caller direction; `identity_version`
selects an immutable reusable pack. Both may be supplied:

```python
brief = Brief(
    title="Exhibition", intent="Show how routes connect",
    identity="Bright architectural maquette; no particles, bloom or glow.",
    identity_version=pack["current_version"],
)
```

For new operations, the caller string is retained unchanged. Pack selection never
overwrites or appends to it. Production receives a separate library-owned
`selected_identity={version_id, pack_id, guidance}` (null without a selection).
The operation and completed revision retain that snapshot with
`identity_semantics:"caller-plus-selected-pack-v1"` and `identity_provenance`.
These are result/request metadata, not new caller-writable Brief fields.
Each new revision resolves the chosen version once; adoption changes the selected
version/snapshot, not caller direction. Old pack rules are not concatenated.
Required pack rules and explicit caller constraints must both be met; conflicting
hard requirements must be reported as a limitation, not silently resolved by dropping
either input. No deterministic prose-conflict detector or model compliance is claimed.
Both channels require the grant's explicit context-disclosure permission.

Historical pack-backed briefs did not distinguish caller text from substituted
pack guidance. On a NEW continuation, an unmarked pack-backed base gets an empty
caller channel plus `identity_provenance.caller_identity:"unavailable"` and its
source revision ID. The ambiguous old field is not reused as caller direction;
the selected pack is resolved afresh. That unknown status remains visible on
later revisions. No lost caller prose is guessed or old record rewritten. Supply
verified recovered direction in current feedback for that operation, or explicitly
create a new brief; feedback alone does not restore the canonical historical brief.
Unmarked caller-only bases retain their text. Unknown explicit semantics or invalid
modern provenance fail with `IDENTITY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN`, before production.
Exact old request retries retain their original comparisons/outcomes and do not
relaunch or rewrite history, even when current prerequisites are unavailable.

## Continue a historical revision without resetting its project

Use `fork_revision(revision_id, name, *, request_id)` to byte-copy an intact retained
revision into a **new project**. It works on an older revision even when the original
project has advanced. The original head/history never move; ordinary `revise` on the
returned new revision still needs a fresh bounded grant and enforces stale-base rules.

```python
fork = tool.fork_revision(
    historical_revision_id,
    "Exact historical continuation",
    request_id="fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210",
)
# Inspect fork["revision_id"] and its artifacts before authorized creative work.
```

CLI: `unfold call fork-revision --args fork.json`. MCP: `unfold_fork_revision`.
Manifest classifies the operation as deterministic; it neither initializes intelligence
nor calls author/render/media probing. It copies generated source/resources and the
revision's retained silent composition MP4s exactly, not flattened media in place of
editable source. New records name the original project/revision/artifacts, verified
source/file hashes and a deterministic-copy receipt. Original render metadata, checks,
model review and usage are attributed under inherited evidence—not newly performed
validation or new charges. No review grants, drafts, feedback queues or pending work
are copied. Exact brief/identity fields and legacy field absence are retained.

Same-library only, currently POSIX no-follow descriptor support required. Selected
pack/reference IDs remain same-library references and are disclosed, not exported as a
portable project archive. Copies have independent regular files, no links. Limits:
1024 source files, 32 opened directories, 512 MiB per file, 1 GiB combined source/MP4,
1 MiB JSON/record metadata, 1–8 composition MP4s, 120-second cooperative copy allowance.
Delivery-derived artifacts, unsafe paths, links/special files, missing/changed material
and unsupported generated-source entries are refused, not silently omitted.

Keep the required exact `request_id`. Equal retries return the same committed IDs,
even if the origin later becomes unavailable. Different arguments conflict. Project,
revision, artifacts and completed receipt publish atomically after checked staging.
Interrupted/pending requests fail `MUTATION_INCOMPLETE` rather than copying again;
`mutation_status(request_id)` exposes planned IDs and retained partial staging.
Concurrent equal calls can observe pending work. A partial copy is not a valid new
project, and a new request ID is not an automatic recovery from an uncertain outcome.
The private-local-store boundary does not defend against an unrestricted same-user
actor replacing files after final checks. No source is executed during the copy;
subsequent rendering still performs its normal runtime/source checks.

## Footage, audio and output

`Brief(reference_id=asset_id, reference_start=seconds, cues=[...])` permits the
agent to inspect up to three footage samples relative to the composition, within
the local frame limit and explicit disclosure permissions. Sampling gaps remain unobserved; no tracking or
source authentication is claimed. Keep cue statements explicit. Existing footage
is referenced as input, never treated as proof that illustrative graphics happened.

```python
reference = tool.import_asset("/chosen/demo.mp4", role="video", mode="reference")
audio = tool.import_asset("/chosen/narration.wav", role="audio")
delivery = tool.configure_delivery(
    revision_id,
    reference_id=reference["id"],
    reference_start=2,
    audio=[{"asset_id": audio["id"], "start": 1, "offset": 0, "duration": 4, "gain": 1}],
    cues=[{"at": 1, "text": "Narration starts"}],
)
overlay = tool.render_delivery(delivery["id"], mode="overlay")
video = tool.render_delivery(delivery["id"], mode="video")
tool.export_handoff(overlay["id"], "/chosen/handoff.zip")
frames = tool.sample_output(video["id"], [1, 3, 5])
```

`configure_delivery` pins hashes and a revision. Times use composition seconds;
`reference_start + composition_time` maps to the recording. Footage scales to fit
the retained canvas (1920×1080 or 1280×720) with letterboxing. Source trimming and audio placement are explicit; no
motion tracking, cropping or region transforms are currently exposed. Up to eight
imported audio tracks can be trimmed, placed and mixed with gain 0–2. Video audio
is 48 kHz stereo AAC with limiting; reference recording audio is excluded. This
profile neither transcribes nor asks a model to listen to imported audio.

`render_delivery(..., mode="overlay")` removes the canvas background, retaining
colored shapes/images, and renders silent ProRes 4444 MOV with real alpha. The
full-frame layer starts at composition time zero. MOV playback in the browser is
not assumed. `mode="video"` composites the same layer over the selected footage
(or composition background) and includes selected audio. Both require intact source
and dependency hashes; neither uses intelligence. The output profile is explicit,
not inferred from a file extension.

`export_handoff` creates a ZIP with the chosen output, separate supplied audio and
a timing manifest with hashes. An overlay handoff never contains reference footage
or recording audio. Combined Video deliberately includes footage in its encoded
output. `sample_output` decodes 1–12 PNG frames without a model. Samples prove neither
continuous temporal quality nor audible quality. Outputs remain independently
traceable to source revision, profile, audio policy and dependency hashes.

The theme icon cycles System → Light → Dark. System is the default and follows
live operating-system appearance changes. An explicit override persists in the
browser without changing composition colors or triggering model work.

Dashboard Save invokes the browser's native save picker when available. Browsers
without that API use their normal download flow and configured destination; Unfold
does not simulate an OS chooser or invent a second destination dialog.

## JSON capability adapter

Every operation above is a public `Unfold` method. The CLI also provides
`unfold call CAPABILITY --args arguments.json` (`--args -` reads stdin).
Capability names use hyphens: `import-asset`, `save-pack`, `review-state`,
`authorize-review`, `submit-refinement`, `configure-delivery`, `render-delivery`,
`export-handoff`, and so forth. Arguments are the corresponding method's named
parameters in a JSON object. `unfold schemas` lists exact signatures, and
`unfold manifest` classifies deterministic versus model-backed capabilities.


Read `unfold call --help` for the complete JSON capability index and
`unfold call CAPABILITY --help` before invoking one. Direct command skills:

- `unfold manifest --help` — Discover available capabilities.
- `unfold schemas --help` — Prepare validated requests.
- `unfold backend-package --help` — Obtain pinned renderer dependencies.
- `unfold doctor --help` — Check local prerequisites.
- `unfold projects --help` — Find work to reopen.
- `unfold inspect --help` — Inspect retained work and integrity.
- `unfold observe --help` — Discover changes since a caller's last visit.
- `unfold rename --help` — Rename a project, pack, asset or output.
- `unfold export --help` — Copy saved media to a caller-owned directory.
- `unfold render --help` — Render retained source again without intelligence.
- `unfold feedback --help` — Retain a targeted comment without spending.
- `unfold address-feedback --help` — Link submitted feedback to its result.
- `unfold cancel --help` — Request cancellation of a synchronous creative operation.
- `unfold create --help` — Animate a new explanation.
- `unfold revise --help` — Apply a change while retaining the earlier composition.
- `unfold dashboard --help` — Open a local review workspace.
- `unfold call --help` — Invoke the JSON capability adapter.

## Optional standard MCP adapter

Install `[mcp]` and configure `unfold-mcp --library /absolute/retained-library` as a
stdio server. `unfold-mcp --help` describes the transport; no MCP dependency is
needed for the ordinary library/CLI. `ui://unfold/review` is a portable MCP App
using the same typed `unfold_*` actions as the model. Media uses bounded standard
resources, never credential-bearing browser URLs. The review needs serverTools,
serverResources and updateModelContext support from its host.

Default server mode denies model-backed creation/refinement. For those, install
`[smart,mcp]`, prepare the renderer, and explicitly enable `--allow-models` with
provider credentials supplied in the server environment. Grants remain required
per operation. Use submit-creation for owned asynchronous creation and
authorize-review plus submit-refinement for bounded follow-up. Exact request_id
retries never relaunch; closing the view never cancels accepted work. Poll
review-state and inspect cancellation/interruption rather than replaying work.

One shared view position is retained per library; drafts are revision-bound
context and grant no authority. The first portable view covers project/revision
review, retained media playback/download, notes and interval refinements, bounded
creation and job cancellation. It does not replace every standalone dashboard or
delivery control. Preview assembly is limited to 32 MiB; use export for larger
media. No MCP sampling/Tasks or browser credential configuration is provided.
